# CMPM120-D1-Cinematic
A cinematic for the D1 assignment for CMPM 120.

## Note: Please click on the very first scene to have audio work. 

## Key Requirements:
#### **3+ distinct visual scenes (with distinct “Scene” classes):** The three distinct scenes are comprised of the scene with the gray background and the studio logo and name, the scene with background image of trees with the arrow that flies across the screen, and the scene with the water, title, and menu. 
#### **2+ audio assets (e.g. background music and a sound effect):** The two audio assets were the brief "whistle" sound that plays once the arrow has flown across, rotated, and become a full arrow, and the second audio asset is the background sound that plays during the last scene.
#### **2+ image assets (one with transparent background):** The image assets that I used were the image that had the scribby lines on paper, the two background images, and the title is a .png file that has a transparent background. 
#### **2+ geometric shapes (rendered in-engine):** The geometric shapes I used that were rendered in-engine were the rectangle that was placed behind the image of scribbly lines because I wanted it to frame that image and the yellow triangle that appears to the left of "Begin" which I hope gave the impression as an icon that is used to navigate the menu.
#### **1+ big fancy text (composed out of engine):** The fancy text is the title of the game, which has also a transparent background. 
#### **1+ multi-line text (rendered in-engine):** The multi-line text that I rendered in-engine is the small menu in the last scene. 
#### **1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black):** I had several fades to black that served as transitions between scenes and I made the fade in from the studio scene to the tree scene have a subtle green color, which I thought was neat. 
#### **1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in from the side):** The arrow on the tree scene slides from the left of the screen to the right and then rotates. The menu in the last scene slides in from the bottom of the screen. 

## CREDITS/ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
#### The image within the frame for the studio logo scene was done briefly by me scribbling lines down on a piece of paper and then taking a picture of that.
#### The sound used in the tree scene is a brief whistle that I found and edited on beepbox.co. It was a stock sound provided by the website, but I placed a note on the website, exported it (which was exported as a 5-second file), and I then shortened the file down in Audacity. The background image for the scene was taken on a trip my family and I took to Santa Cruz the summer before I officially began as a first-year. The arrow that slides in and rotates and the arrow that is filled in was made by me using Krita and exported as png files.
#### The audio used in the title screen scene was recorded on my walk back from class on 4/24/23. I stood on a trail by Oakes College and used my phone’s recording app. I then took the file to Audacity to raise the volume, normalize it, and trim the portions where the mic picked up my phone making contact with my sweater. The image was taken on a trip my oldest brother, youngest brother, and I took to Mount Baldy in Southern California (I do need to check in with my brother, since I could be wrong with where we were when I took this photo). The title was made using Krita, where I used its text options and drew a little brush stroke underneath the title. I exported it as a png file.
